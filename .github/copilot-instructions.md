# Copilot Instructions for Rocket Wars

Prefer pure functions over classes where possible.

Use Javascript but with JSDoc comments for type safety and IntelliSense.

Do not tell me to start python http.server or run the command yourself - I am using live server and will test changes with this.

If you are not sure something will work, or I tell you it's not working, then use `console.log` to add debugging information.

Use `npm run check-syntax` after any significant changes to ensure no syntax errors.

This is a Phaser.js game, so always prefer Phaser conventions over generic web development patterns. When in doubt, consult the Phaser.js documentation and maintain the existing code style.

Never modify AiAgentNotes.md or this file.
