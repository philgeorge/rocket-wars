# Player Setup Implementation - Complete

## What's Implemented

✅ **Two-Step Player Setup Process**
- Step 1: Name input using DOM overlay (no Phaser keyboard conflicts)
- Step 2: Base selection using Phaser highlights with camera scrolling

✅ **DOM Overlay for Name Input**
- Transparent overlay that allows camera scrolling underneath
- Proper keyboard focus management (WASD keys available for typing)
- Input validation (max 10 characters)
- Clean UI styling matching game theme

✅ **Phaser-based Base Selection**
- Green highlighted circles show available bases
- Click to select a base for turret placement
- Bases are removed from available list once selected
- Full camera/scrolling controls available during selection

✅ **Complete Integration**
- Player names appear in game UI (stats panel)
- Turrets are placed at selected base locations
- Player data flows through entire game system
- Camera controls properly disabled/enabled during setup

## How It Works

1. **Game starts** → generates landscape with flat bases
2. **Player Setup begins** → DOM overlay appears
3. **For each player:**
   - Enter name (DOM input with WASD typing support)
   - Click "Continue to Base Selection"
   - Camera scrolling enabled, bases highlighted in green
   - Click a highlighted base to select it
   - Base is removed from available list
4. **Setup complete** → turrets placed, combat begins
