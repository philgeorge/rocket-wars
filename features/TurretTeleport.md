# Turret Teleport Feature

This is a feature that allows the user to move their turret to a different base, instead of taking a shot. The purpose of this is to avoid a player being trapped in a location that's easy for others to hit, or a location that's out of range of other players and therefore cannot get involved in shooting.

- Initiate teleport by mouse: Click on any flat base section of the landscape.
- Initiate teleport by keyboard: Press "T" key
- The game should then go into "base selection" mode - this is exactly the same as is currently used at the start of the game, except it's just done for the player whose turn it is
- The turn timer continues to count down during teleport base selection, therefore the base selection panel should be displayed lower down on the screen, so that it doesn't overlap the environment and player stats panels. If the timer runs out without the player selecting a new base, then they have wasted their turn as it passes to the next player (or the game ends)
- If the player has selected a new base, then their turn ends
