# Chunked Terrain System Implementation

## What Was Done

I've successfully implemented a **chunked terrain system** that converts your existing landscape points into rectangular chunks while maintaining compatibility with all existing game features.

## Key Changes

### 1. **New File: `src/chunkedLandscape.js`**
- Converts landscape points into terrain chunks
- Each chunk is a rectangular segment (25px wide by default)
- Maintains same landscape shape as before, but with a "squared off" appearance
- Includes destructible terrain and falling chunk physics

### 2. **Modified: `src/landscape.js`**
- Added `useChunkedTerrain` parameter to `setupWorldLandscape()`
- Maintains full backward compatibility with original system

### 3. **Modified: `src/main.js`**
- Enabled chunked terrain by default (`useChunkedTerrain = true`)
- You can easily switch back by setting it to `false`

## Visual Difference

### Original System (useChunkedTerrain = false)

## Number of Chunks

Your current system uses `Math.floor(worldWidth / 50)` points, so:
- **2000px world** = 40 landscape points → **80 chunks** (25px each)
- **3000px world** = 60 landscape points → **120 chunks** (25px each)

Each chunk is **25px wide** by default (vs 50px spacing in original), giving you **2x the terrain resolution**.

## Destructible Features Ready

The chunked system includes these destructible terrain functions (ready to integrate):

1. **`createTerrainDestruction()`** - Destroy chunks in explosion radius
2. **`updateFallingChunks()`** - Make unsupported chunks fall with gravity
3. **`checkChunkedTerrainCollision()`** - Collision detection for projectiles

## Testing

To test the chunked system:
1. Start the game normally
2. The landscape will now appear "squared off" instead of angular
3. All existing features (base selection, turret placement, shooting) work unchanged
4. Flat bases are preserved exactly as before

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for you to:
1. **Test the visual difference** - see how the squared-off terrain looks
2. **Add destructible terrain** - integrate the destruction functions into your projectile collision handling
3. **Tune chunk size** - adjust the `chunkWidth` parameter for different granularity

## Easy Toggle

You can easily switch between systems by changing one line in `main.js`:
```javascript
const useChunkedTerrain = false; // Original angular terrain
const useChunkedTerrain = true;  // New chunked terrain
```

The chunked terrain system is now fully implemented and ready for you to test!
